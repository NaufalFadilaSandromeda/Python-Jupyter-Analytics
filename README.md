# Project Title: Kaggle Dataset Analysis

## Description
This project utilizes multiple datasets sourced from Kaggle to perform data analysis and model creation for customer behavior prediction. The objective is to analyze customer purchase history, demographic data, and feedback to build predictive models and generate insights. This repository contains code, scripts, and instructions for processing and analyzing these datasets.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are available on Kaggle. You can access and download them using the links below:

1. **Sleep Time Prediction**  
   Description: This dataset is designed for machine learning models to predict sleep duration based on daily lifestyle parameters. The data includes features like workout time, reading time, phone usage time, work hours, caffeine intake, and relaxation time, with sleep time as the target variable.

2. **Crop Yield of a Farm**  
   Description: This dataset is designed for the prediction of crop yield in agricultural farms. It includes 3000 data points generated through a set of simulated environmental and farming features. These features—such as rainfall, soil quality, farm size, sunlight hours, and fertilizer usage—have been carefully selected to represent key factors that affect crop productivity.
   The crop yield values (in tons per hectare) are generated using a predefined equation that combines the effects of these factors. This dataset is ideal for exploring regression models, testing machine learning algorithms, or building predictive models for agricultural analysis.
