# Project Title: Kaggle Dataset Analysis

## Description
This project utilizes multiple datasets sourced from Kaggle to perform data analysis and model creation for customer behavior prediction. The objective is to analyze customer purchase history, demographic data, and feedback to build predictive models and generate insights. This repository contains code, scripts, and instructions for processing and analyzing these datasets.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are available on Kaggle. You can access and download them using the links below:

1. **Sleep Time Prediction**  
   Description: This dataset is designed for machine learning models to predict sleep duration based on daily lifestyle parameters. The data includes features like workout time, reading time, phone usage time, work hours, caffeine intake, and relaxation time, with sleep time as the target variable.
